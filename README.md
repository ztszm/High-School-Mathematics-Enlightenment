##Several Thoughts on Launching the "High School Mathematics Enlightenment"

###Hello everyone, I am a Java development engineer and also working in the high school education and training industry. I can't bear to see many students scratching their ears and cheeks while studying mathematics. So I summarized some experiences from my substitute class experience and prepared to help students with math learning through mini programs. This is the original intention of launching this project.

###For most students who are hovering around the passing line, understanding the knowledge points and corresponding exercises are particularly important. Therefore, the presentation layer of this project looks like this:

###Each class lasts about 15 minutes, and after listening to the course, there will be accompanying assignments to consolidate the knowledge points. With the premise of completing 80% of the exercises in the course and ensuring a 60% accuracy rate, one can qualify for a challenge. This challenge will have rewards of varying amounts to form positive feedback and stimulate students' interest in learning mathematics.
